Tiny utility to prevent your PC from locking, sleeping or activating screensaver after idle time determined by various system settings. This program does not change these settings, what may be useful if you need to have effect not long time, because after restarting OS or system crash there is no options to be saved. Actual effect works by simulating that you've pressed the SHIFT key once every 59 seconds.
